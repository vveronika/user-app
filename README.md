# Users app

Simple application just to fetch and display some users and their details in modal. 

Created to practice Typescript, write some test and try some new libraries. 

New functionalities like adding and removing some posts, animations with react-spring, more tests, etc. are coming soon. 

To run the client application (after cloning it on your computer), in the project directory:

### `npm install`
will install all required dependencies, and

### `npm start`
will run the app in the development mode. It should open the browser and start automatically, but in case if something went wrong, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Application uses this API: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
